# goSport
Bringing Sports to the Next Level
REVOLUTIONIZING THE SPORT SOCIETY THROUGH GAMES
What it does
When you create a personalized user in goSport, you locate your friends and whenever they want to play a game, if it matches with your interests you will get a notification supplying the time and location of your game.

How we built it
We built it using firebase to store user custom settings and we used Xcode to design the app.

Challenges we ran into
We couldn't use CocoaPods because we didn't have admin password on the provided computers, so we had to find another way to download the fles. Also, the emulator never worked. We had planned on using Android Studio on our laptops, but it wasn't working, so we had to come up with a new way to do it on the spot.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We learned how to use Xcode and we had no idea how to before.

What we learned
Xcode, Firebase

What's next for goSport
goSport can solve so many organization problems so you don't have to deal with them and every active person deserves to have this app on their phone.
